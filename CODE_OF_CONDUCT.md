- Communication between 2 or more collaborators should be done over a voice-call if the issue being discussed can be misunderstood or interpreted very differently.
- When a collaborator starts working on an issue they will set a __*start-date*__ on that issue.
- When a collaborator finishes work on an issue they will set an __*end-date*__ on that issue.
- A Pull Request is only allowed to be merged if or when it has been reviewed & accepted by 2 or more reviewers.
  - When reviewing a Pull Request the code needs to be examined for errors.
  - When reviewing a Pull Request the code needs to be checked out & tested manually for errors.
- When a collaborator is working on an issue they are responsible for writing the first set of unit-tests for that code.
  - The collaborator assigned to the issue should write __*at minimum*__ 1 'happy-path'-test.
  - The collaborator assigned to the issue should write __*at minimum*__ 1 negative test.
  - The collaborator assigned to the issue should write tests for all edge-cases they can think of that run a __*reasonable*__ risk of occuring in daily operation.
